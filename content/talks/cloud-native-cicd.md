Title: "Cloud Native CI/CD"
Subtitle: "What? Why? How?"
date: 
Abstract: "Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) have taken root in software teams of all sizes: the process of delivering applications from dev to prod is increasingly automated, tested, and measured. As applications migrate to cloud infrastructure, so can CI/CD systems. Cloud-native principles like immutability and configuration as code are giving rise to a new generation of DevOps tools, supporting faster, more reliable software delivery. In this workshop, participants will learn cloud-native fundamentals, and craft a pipeline definition that continuously builds and deploys a sample microservice application using Google’s serverless Cloud Build CI/CD platform. Through hands-on tutorials and challenges, we’ll gain experience with containerized toolchains, versioned configuration, and other best practices of modern developer tooling."
