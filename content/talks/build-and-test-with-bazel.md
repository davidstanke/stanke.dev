Title: "Build and Test Your Code Faster with Bazel"
Subtitle: "The Cloud-accelerated Build System"
date: 
Abstract: "Is your build slow? Are you testing less thoroughly than you should? Modern caching and parallelization techniques can be harnessed to achieve fast, repeatable build and test cycles, ending difficult trade-offs between test hygiene and deployment velocity. In this talk, you'll learn how Google designed its open source build system, Bazel, to perform fast, reproducible builds of any size codebase in any language (Java, C++, Python, Go, Javascript, and dozens more). You'll see a live demo of how Bazel efficiently builds a complex, polyglot application, and how compilation and test execution can be distributed to a scalable cluster of cloud executors for even more speed."
