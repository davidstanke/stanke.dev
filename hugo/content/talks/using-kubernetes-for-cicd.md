Title: "Using Kubernetes for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery"
Subtitle: "with Carlos Sanchez"
date: 2020-04-25
Abstract: "Teams take weeks to set up and manage Kubernetes and then a few more weeks to develop and deliver microservices on Kubernetes in the cloud. This talk discusses several open source projects that can help you streamline development and delivery of applications on Kubernetes in the cloud. This session demonstrates how using the best tools in the Kubernetes ecosystem, such as Jenkins X, Tekton, Docker, Helm, Skaffold, ChartMuseum, Knative, Prow and others can help you create a fully automated setup. Teams no longer have to stitch myriads of independent solutions together to ship their first line of code. They can now rely on automatically plumbed Jenkins declarative pipelines-as-code that deliver microservices on managed Kubernetes solutions from major cloud providers, like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This session will also discuss the implementation of GitOps. Environments like staging and production are Git repos and promotion of versioned artifacts happens via pull requests and Jenkins pipelines. SoD (segregation of duties) has historically impeded success of the continuous paradigm and GitOps alleviate those problems with more auditable approaches."
