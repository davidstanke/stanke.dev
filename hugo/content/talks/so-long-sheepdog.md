Title: "So Long, Sheepdog"
Subtitle: "Towards a Cloud-Native CI/CD"
date: 
Abstract: "We, as DevOps practitioners, have embraced the cloud: we increasingly deploy applications to cloud infrastructure, including Kubernetes, serverless, and other modern runtimes, where we treat our servers as livestock, not pets. But the CI/CD systems we typically use to build and deploy those applications lag behind. We maintain our own tools as fragile, bespoke one-offs. These are sheepdogs: pets we use to tend our livestock. Let’s treat ourselves to some of that modernization: what benefits can we get? We’ll review the hallmarks of a healthy DevOps practice, and describe how to achieve key capabilities across a range of strategies, from incremental modernization of established systems to the brave new world of a greenfield, cloud-native CI/CD platform."
